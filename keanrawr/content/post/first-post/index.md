Hello world!

This is the first official post on my new blog! In this blog I'll talk about data projects that I develop on my free time, and some of the techniques that I've learned over my professional career.

A little about me: I'm a data scientist that loves to write code, I love writing in R but focus mainly on python for my professional work. I love playing basketball, not actually a real hard-core NBA fan, but I might start getting more interested in the league to do some fantasy league analysis.

I'm also a big League of Legends fan, haven't really played much since graduating from university.

Hope that anyone that reads find some interesting material.
