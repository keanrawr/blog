My name is Antonio Herrera, but I generally go by @keanrawr on the internet. I'm an actuary by formal traning by La Salle University in Mexico City. Since my last semesters in school I decided to focus my carrer on data science, I really love math and statistics, it was a no brainer to go start a carrer in data.

I'm fluent in both R and python, I was taught multivariate statistics with R in school, but professionally I've written code mainly in python. Most of my side-projects are written with R, just because I really enjoy writing R in general. My experience has been mainly on:

1. Sales forecasts
2. Recommender systems
3. Customer satisfaction analytics
4. People analytics

If you want to get in contact with me, you can DM me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/KeanRawr) or message me [via linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-herrera-98b088124/). I love talking about data.
