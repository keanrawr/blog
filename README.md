# Blog Source Code

This is the source code for the blog that is published at [http://keanrawr.github.io](http://keanrawr.github.io/). The site was build using the [HUGO framework](https://gohugo.io/), a static site framework written in go.

This is a simple and fun way to build a static site for my random and sparse blogging activities.

The site uses the [hugo-theme-stack](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-stack/) theme.

The static files served with github pages are located in the `public` git submodule.
